RookMotion watch link  allows new and existing applications to integrate RookMotion functionalities for training measurement, tracking, and analysis.

RookMotion watch link  is designed with the intention to be:

* Fast Integration: Useful to integrate fast and easy using pre-created views with RookMotion design and pre-automated flows. For reference: 4h to re-create the demo app.
* Full personalization: Better for apps with a dedicated development team, developers can call each SDK function in theirs desired order and create and fill their with a personalized UI.

These functionalities are:

* User's info, workouts, rewards, and statistics management in complement with the RookMotion API.

## Package usage

###  RWCommunicationManager class

```swift
public class RWCommunicationManager
```

The `RWCommunicationManager` class allows the watch app communicate with the iOS companion app.

Your iOS app and watchOS app must both create and configure an instance of this class at some point during their execution

The CommunicationManager must be configured and activated before you attempt to send messages or obtain information about the state of the connection.

| Returns      | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|```void```      | ```configureSession()``` |
|```void``` | ```sendInfo(_ info: [String: Any])``` |


#### configureSession()
```swift
public func configureSession()
```
Configure the communication session with the iOS app

#### sendInfo()
```swift
public func sendInfo(_ info: [String: Any])
```
Sends the specified data dictionary to the counterpart.

Call this method when you want to send a dictionary of data to the counterpart and ensure that itâ€™s delivered. Dictionaries sent using this method are queued on the other device and delivered in the order in which they were sent. After a transfer begins, the transfer operation continues even if the app is suspended.

##### Example
```swift
let communicationManager  = RWCommunicationManager.shared
sensorManager.configureSession()
let info = ["sync": "info"]
sensorManager.sendInfo(info)
```


### SendPendingTraining

Calling this method sends a the training object to the device paired.

```swift
  public func sendPendingTraining(_ unfinishTraining: RWTrainingInfo)
```

**parameters**
- unfinishTraining: `RWTrainingInfo` objet to send.

#### Example
```swift
let communicationManager  = RWCommunicationManager.shared
let storageManager: RMStorageManager = RMStorageManager()

func sendTraining() {
  guard let training = storageManager.getUnfinishedTrainings().first { 
    return
  }
  communicationManager.sendPendingTraining(training)
}
```

### Delegate

You must assign an object conforming to the RWCommunicationDelegate protocol to this. The delegate is responsible for responding to session-related changes, for processing incoming data, and for responding to errors.

#### RWCommunicationDelegate

A set of methods that provide the data related to the connection information

```swift
public protocol RWCommunicationDelegate
```

|Function| Description|
|-------|------------|
|```session(_ session: WCSession, messageData: [String : Any])```|Tells the delegate when a message has been received. |
|```session(_ session: WCSession, userInfo: [String : Any])``` |Tells the delegate when a dictionary has been received.|
|```session(_ session: WCSession, message: [String : Any])```| Tells the delegate when a message has been received. |
|```userInfoSaved(_ session: WCSession, watchMessage: [String: Any])```| Tells the delegate when a new user information has been received and stored. |



### AuthorizationManager

```swift

```
AuthorizationManager performs these requests asynchronously. If you call this method  a type of data that the user hasnâ€™t previously granted or denied permission for in this app, the system automatically displays the permission form, listing all the requested permissions. After the user has finished responding, this method calls its completion block on a background queue. If the user has already chosen to grant or prohibit access to all of the types specified, HealthKit calls the completion without prompting the user.
